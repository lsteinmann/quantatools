  abstract = {Abstract: It is generally held by scholars ofGreek metrology thatthe length ofafootstandard can be derived from the dimensions ofbuilding elements. The Erechtheion at Athens is used as a case study to demonstrate that besides architectural measurements and inscriptional evidence, statistical analysis should also be used in the process. The method is based on D. G. Kendall s cosine quantogram analysis, and the result validity is assessed by Monte Carlo simulation. In the secondpart ofthe study an artificial data set based on the Arsenal in Piraeus is used to study the effects ofnoise on quantogram analysis. The main results ofthe study are that based on building block dimensions the length ofthe Erechtheionfoot unit can be established as c. 324 mm and that a uniform noise-level of{$\pm$}10 mm does not cause difficulties in identifying units ofquarter-foot or larger in quantogram analysis. Key words: Greek architecture, cosine quantogram analysis, Monte Carlo simulation, kernel density estimates, metrology, foot unit, Erechtheion, Arsenal in Piraeus},

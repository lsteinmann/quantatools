Description: The quantatools-package implements algorithms from cosine
    quantogram related research as proposed by D. G. Kendall in 1974. The
    aim of the package is to provide tools for researchers looking to find
    the base measurement unit (such as antique foot in building
    measurements) from a set of measurements.
